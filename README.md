# Medicine ordering chatbot and integration with WhatsApp


To develop an efficient and user-friendly chatbot that enables users to order medicines online via WhatsApp and have them delivered to their desired location. The chatbot should be able to handle user queries related to medicine availability, prices, dosage, side effects, and provide recommendations for OTC medicines. The integration with WhatsApp should be seamless, secure, and allow users to receive updates on the order status and track their delivery.
